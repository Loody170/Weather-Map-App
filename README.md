# Weather Map App

A simple React.js app that uses websockets that connects to my back end Weather API to display real time weather data for Saudi Arabia cities live on the map

I used react-leaflet library which is an excellent choice for integrating maps into React applications. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for working with maps and allows for excellent integration of mapping functionality into React components.

The app subscribes to the /weather/live WebSocket endpoint to receive live weather updates for cities in Saudi Arabia. These updates are then displayed on the map using markers or, which provides interactivity and visually appealing way to explore weather data in real-time.

I hosted the web app on Vercel, and you can visit it from **[this link](https://weather-map-app-pink.vercel.app/live-radar)**
